## Introduction
SINGALAM (Sistem Informasi dan Gerakan Layanan Kota Malang) is an inclusive, AI-powered public complaint platform built to ensure that every citizen—including those with disabilities—can access public services independently and effectively.<br>
With a voice-first interface, real-time AI chatbot, and transparent report tracking, SINGALAM bridges the gap between public service access and digital inclusivity, especially for the visually impaired in Malang City.

## 💡 Key Features
🗣️ Voice-Guided Interface: Navigate every page with built-in voice instructions, designed for screen reader compatibility.<br>
🤖 MalangBot – AI Chatbot: Instant responses to public service-related questions using RAG-based chatbot technology.<br>
📄 Inclusive Complaint Form: Submit reports using either speech or text input, accessible and efficient for all users.<br>
🔍 Complaint History Tracking: Keep users updated with real-time report status and responses from the authorities.<br>
♿ Accessibility-First Design: High color contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support built-in.<br>
